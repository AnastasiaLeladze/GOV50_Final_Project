## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to socio-economic situation in my homeland, Georgia. With the Russia-Ukraine War, a lot happened in the region, influencing people's positions about staying or leaving the country, changing the demographic setup of the population, promoting inflaiton-led "economic growth," etc. I want to explore some data associated with these changes.
